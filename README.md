# Welcome to Bonne Xai
 
 
Bonne Xai aims to repurpose materials for creative and practical uses. I guess the term is called "upcycling". 


My first product is chalk bags for climbers that are made from jeans that are torn in places such that it can be donated to anyone else (thighs and crotch are the most common places). By using these old jeans, climbers now have a place to put their phones and snacks! My favorite thing about climbing is honestly the snacking once you reach the top. Some jeans also have convenient pockets and loops to hold brushes. I've also increased the pocket size of pants created with women's jeans (this was very cathartic). I have made about 10 of these challk bags so far and have given them to my close climber friends as gifts. They received so many compliments about them that I decided to make more and try to sell them on Etsy.


Another side project of mine is to learn financial analysis so I decided to multitask and use this as an opportunity to build my financial modeling skills by building them from scratch and tracking the progress of this little side business. I am also interested in learning more about data analytics and data visualization so I will try to incorporate those skills as well. I will be posting my progress on github and update in chronological order on this README, with the latest date on top.


Using recycled materials keeps costs as low as possible, so using this experience to learn financial modeling will be limited. Let's see how far this journey goes.


## Progress update

### 5/14/2019
- started production but not at full capacity (learning a lot about sewing machine maintenance... by breaking it a lot. Did not expect this to be an obstacle, but solving issues with the user manual and youtube)
Next to-do plan:
- complete financial modeling courses on Lynda.com
